# How to show and customize the week number in the Flutter Calendar (SfCalendar)?

This example demonstrates How to show and customize the week number in the Flutter Calendar.

# Display week number in the Calendar
Use the [showWeekNumber](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/SfCalendar/showWeekNumber.html) property of the calendar to display the week number in the Flutter calendar. Week numbers will be displayed based on the ISO standard. 

In the month view, it is displayed at the left side as a separate column. whereas in the week and work week view it is displayed beside the view header panel, and for day and timeline views it is displayed next to the header text in the header panel of the calendar. 

The week number is not applicable fo the schedule view in the calendar.

# Customizing week number appearance.
In this sample we have customized the week number styles by using the calendar's [weekNumberStyle](https://pub.dev/documentation/syncfusion_flutter_calendar/latest/calendar/WeekNumberStyle-class.html) property.
